# Skittle-Dispenser
A project I did in my free time to challenge by coding and Arduino abilities and to create a cool device that gives you a little treat after all your hard work. It's also really cool to flex to your friends that you built this. 

This code is build to use an LCD screen, a joystick, a servo, and an Arduino Uno to dispense Skittles or other round candies to you and all your friends and family.
A great added bonus is that you get to learn some code and how these parts work together to complete a task.
